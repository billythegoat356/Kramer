<strong>
Kramer is a next level obfuscation tool written in Python3 allowing you to obfuscate
<br>
your Python3 code easily and securely. It uses <a href="https://github.com/billythegoat356/Berserker">Berserker</a>'s obfuscation but in a more advanced way
<br>
making your code nearly impossible to be deobfuscated.

### <p align="center">📋 Examples 📋</p>

<br><br>
**Unobfuscated**:<br>
```python3
input("Hello world!")
```
<br><br>
**Obfuscated**:<br>
```python3
�������������������������������������������������������������
```

<strong>- The result file is not a python file (.PY) but a compiled python file (.PYC) renamed to .PY</strong>
<br>
<strong>- Can't compile the file to exe (since it's basically a PYC file) but you can compile the PY file in the logs folder</strong>
<br>
<strong>- Can be deobfuscated using a PYC decompilator then some Python algorithmic, but it requires a certain knowledge</strong>
